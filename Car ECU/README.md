# Vehicle_State_Estimator
The system is based on two Tiva C kits to simulate both ECUs, we will be injecting the current time once from a windows PC over serial interface to the Vehicle State Estimator ECU,  we will then be communicating data to the Measurement ECU which will perform some calculations and measurements over this data.
